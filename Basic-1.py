#Part-1

# Making a variable and add a data to the variable
# Variable can be named by using alphabets, and numbers
# Heare we go 

a = 10
b = 20

# Printing the variable data by using    print(varible name)
# we can even print some text by using print("Text")

print("value of variable a")
print(a)
print("value of variable b")
print(b)

# to make code less complicated and less lenth we can put both variables and text in one print command
#

c = 30
print("value of variable c", c)
print("OR")
print(c, "is value of variable c")
print(" ")
print(" ")
print(" ")
print(" ")



# Mathmatic calculation

# We may put sine like + for addition, - for subtraction, * for multiplication, / for division in decimal, // for division in whole numbers

# CODE - 1.

a=10
b=20

c=a+b #similarly we can use diffrent sines to do calculation
print("sum of 10 and 20 = ", c)



# Using exit command
# Exit is used in code the to exit the program before completing it

# CODE - 1

a=10
b=12
print("10+12 =")
c=a+b

exit()
print(c)
